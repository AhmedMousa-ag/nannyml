which we equally value and appreciate!

  or talk about our project with your friends and co-workers. The more people use it, the more feedback we get
  and the faster we can improve our product!

  our Slack channel. Feel free to engage in the discussion of various topics we have there

  understand what you like seeing, while reaching a bigger audience.

  cool swag to give away to the community.

Contribute to the codebase
--------------------------



- **Report bugs**: inform us of things breaking or improvements you'd like to see by submitting an issues on
  our `issues page`_. Just use one of the easy templates provided so we know all we have to know.
- **Smash some bugs**: look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with `bug` and
  `help wanted` is open to whoever wants to implement it. Issues labeled `good first issue`
  are well suited for first time contributors.
- **Implement features**: look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
  and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.
- **Write documentation**: it might not seem very glorious, but it is some of the hardest yet most important work to be
  done. Additions to the official NannyML docs, docstrings or even on the web in blog posts or articles are highly
  appreciated!

  what you don't like even more! There are two ways to give feedback:

Get started coding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ready to contribute code? Here's how to set up `nannyml` for local development.

1. Fork the `nannyml` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally: ::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/nannyml.git

3. Ensure poetry_ is installed.

.. note::

    When installing poetry on Mac OSX Monterey, if you get a permission denied error for ``.zshrc``,
    you will have to add the following manually using ``sudo``: ``export PATH="$HOME/.poetry/bin:$PATH‚Äù``

4. Install dependencies and start your virtualenv. Execute the following from within your local repository directory: ::

    $ poetry install

5. Create a branch for local development: ::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

  Now you can make your changes locally.

6. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the
   tests, including testing other Python versions, with tox: ::

    $ poetry run tox

7. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub: ::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

8. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.


.. _poetry: https://python-poetry.org/docs/

Pull Request Guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in ``README.md``.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10. Check
   the project's `github actions page`_ and make sure that the tests pass
   for all supported Python versions.
